1) Ask the user to enter a single integer value(n) and write a java method “multiply” that
returns the multiplication of every multiple of 4 from 1 up to the provided integer n.
If the user inputs 13 then the sum of 4 * 8 *12 is 384. 384 will be the output.
2) Ask the user to enter a string and print its palindrome. For example:
Enter a string: 10011
Palindrome of the string: 11001
Enter a string: output
Palindrome of the string: tuptuo
3) Write a program where the user will provide an integer n and the program will print the sum of
even numbers up to N.
Example:
Enter an integer: 6
Result: 12
N.B: The sum of 2+4+6 = 12, hence it should print 12.
4) Ask the user to enter the size of an array and create an array with some values to find the
frequency of an element in the array. Say the array has elements:1,6,2,3,4,5,2,3,4,6,6,6,7,8,2,
and the user gives input = 6.
The program should print “6 is present 4 times in the array”, and if the input is not found, then
print “Not present.”
5) The lengths of the adjacent/opposite sides of a right triangle should be taken from the user, and
suppose that the lengths of these two sides (adjacent & opposite) are equal. You must display a
right-facing triangle with the character * filled in according to the lengths of its adjacent and
opposite lines, as shown :
6) The user provides an integer N, and then prints the sum of the Fibonacci series up to that Nth
term. It should be done using recursion. The program will only end if 0 or 1 is given as input.
Example:
Enter N: 4
Sum: 0+1+1+2 =4
Enter N:5
Sum: 0+1+1+2+3 = 7
Enter N: 0
End.
7) Suppose you went to buy a furniture. Each piece of furniture is different like the “Small Cabinet
”, ”Large Cabinet” and “Kitchen Cabinet” which has its own features. The small cabinet has two
drawers and a single door, The large cabinet has two doors along with 3 drawers whereas the
kitchen cabinet doesn’t have any drawers, only one door. All cabinets are colourful except small
cabinet. Now, create a Java class with the following characteristics called "Furniture":
"numOfDrawer(s):" (an integer), "type:" (a string), "isColourful:" (a boolean), "numOfDoor" (an
integer), and "cost" (a double). Also, include a constructor that takes in values for all of the
attributes and a method "information" that displays each attribute's value for a specific
Furniture object. Then, construct two Furniture objects with various attribute values, and call
the "information” method on each of them in the main method(One among the two objects
must take input of its attributes from the user ).
N.B: The cost of :
“Small Cabinet ”:(Tk 12,000), ”Large Cabinet” :(Tk 19,000), and “Kitchen Cabinet” ”:(Tk 9,000).
Example : (here output is given for only 1 object)
Input:
Enter the type.: Small Cabinet
IsColourful( true/false ): false
No. of Door(s): 1
No. of Drawer(s): 2
Cost (Tk): 12,000
Output:
The furniture type is a Small Cabinet
No colour
1 door(s)
2 drawer(s)
The cost of the furniture is Tk 12,000
